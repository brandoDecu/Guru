    <string name="self_awareness_assessment_outline">Self-Awareness Assessment outline</string>
    <string name="assessment_intro">Our approach  to  teaching  and training  at Abhyasa  Ashram  is  one  of coaching  in  one-to-one  or  small  group  sessions  (satsang).  The purpose of coaching sessions on the Self-Assessment outline  is to help  you  learn how to self-assess.  The  Self-Assessment  is  truly  intended  to  be  an  assessment by  yourself of  yourself. The coach is not here to analyze you or diagnose you like a typical medical or psychological assessment might be done. It is your personal exploration of your own current state of life and being. The coach has done this before and is here to facilitate your own introspection and observation.The items of self-awareness listed below are from the perspective of yoga as seen through the tradition. By increasing self-awareness one gradually comes to see that these are not who we really are, which leads to the realization of the witness of these, the true Self.</string>

    <string name="assessment_what_to_look_for">What to look for in each area of self-assessment?</string>
    <string name="assessment_for_each_of_the_areas">For each of the areas of self-assessment, have the following orientations of what to look for:</string>
    <string name="areas_of_assessment_bullet_1">• What am I doing well that I need to continue doing?</string>
    <string name="areas_of_assessment_bullet_2">• What am I doing that I need to do more of?</string>
    <string name="areas_of_assessment_bullet_3">• What am I doing that I need to reduce or stop doing entirely?</string>
    <string name="areas_of_assessment_bullet_4">• What am I not doing that I need to start doing?</string>
    <string name="areas_of_assessment_bullet_5">• In what way does this relate to my current situation?</string>
    <string name="areas_of_assessment_bullet_6">• How might I plan with this in relation to my future situation?</string>
    <string name="frequency_of_assessments">Frequency of Self-Assessments</string>
    <string name="frequency_bullet1">• Initial Self-Assessment with coach</string>
    <string name="frequency_bullet2">• Ongoing Self-Assessment and training</string>
    <string name="frequency_bullet3">• Monthly scanning Self-Assessment</string>
    <string name="frequency_bullet4">• Quarterly complete Self-Assessment and needs analysis</string>
    <string name="frequency_bullet5">• Annual thorough Self-Assessment with coach</string>
    <string name="assessment_instructions">Wherever  there  are  points  that  draw your  attention,  for  which  you  have  some need to do something, change something, etc., then check that  item and make your note  in the space  below. Press next or swipe left to start the self-awareness assessment.</string>
    <string name="assessment_lots_of_jargon">Initially, this may  seem  complex  with lots of jargon to memorize. Rather quickly, however, it becomes  natural  to  witness  these  aspects  of  your  being.  Gradually,  you  come  to  realize  the one  who  is  observing  these  various  aspects  of  our  self-structure  (antahkarana,  or  inner-instrument). This leads to the doorway of deep meditation and contemplation.</string>
